Should've went for coffee
on that Saturday you saw me
Should've picked my phone up
every time you tried
to call me
But,
I never thought it'd be so soon
I never thought
that I would lose you 'cause
It's not that complicated
when you love someone,
you tell 'em that you do
Don't waste a second
or a breath,
you don't know
when you're gonna lose them
Now they're gone,
but you didn't make that call
And now you live
with your regrets
because it's all your fault
So it breaks my heart
that I let you leave
Hurts my head
seein' memories of you
There ain't a thing
I wouldn't do
To get a moment back with you
So it breaks my heart
that I let you leave
Burn so hard,
learnin' how to grieve for you
I should've let you
know the truth
'Cause when you love someone,
you tell 'em that you,
tell 'em that you do
Should've came to visit more
and gave you my attention
Should've took more
photographs and asked
you all my questions like
"What would you do
if you were me?"
It feels too soon
to let you leave
And would you call me crazy
if I told you
I still call you?
'Cause sometimes
you're the only one I feel like
I can talk to
It feels like
my heart is torn in two
And you took the other
half with you 'cause
It's not that complicated
when you love someone,
you tell 'em that you do
Don't waste a second
or a breath, you don't
know when you're
gonna lose them
Now they're gone,
but you didn't make that call
And now you live
with your regrets
because it's all your fault
So it breaks my heart
that I let you leave
Hurts my head
seein' memories of you
There ain't a thing
I wouldn't do
To get a moment back
with you
So it breaks my heart
that I let you leave
Burn so hard,
learnin' how to grieve for you
I should've let you
know the truth
'Cause when you love someone,
you tell 'em that you,
tell 'em that you do
You tell 'em that you do
'Cause when you love someone,
you tell 'em that you,
tell 'em that you do
